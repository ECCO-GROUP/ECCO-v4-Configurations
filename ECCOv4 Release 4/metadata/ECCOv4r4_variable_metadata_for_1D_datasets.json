Changes in ocean mass due to evaporation, precipitation, runoff, and sea-ice growth/melt are reflected in model sea level. However, as a consequence of the Boussinsq formulation, changes to seawater density due to net buoyancy fluxes (e.g., global mean surface heating/cooling) do not change model sea level anomaly (ETAN) via seawater expansion/contraction. Changes in global ocean density therefore induce a spurious change in model ocean bottom pressure (PHIBOT) via 'virtual mass fluxes'.

This correction is used to calculate dynamic sea surface height (SSH) and ocean bottom pressure (OBP).
