-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filename: GRID_GEOMETRY_ECCO_v4r4_native_llc0090.nc 
shortname: ECCO_L4_GEOMETRY_LLC0090GRID_V4R4

This dataset provides geometric parameters for the lat-lon-cap 90 (llc90) native model grid from the ECCO Version 4 Release 4 (V4r4) ocean and sea-ice state estimate. Parameters include areas and lengths of grid cell sides; horizontal and vertical coordinates of grid cell centers and corners; grid rotation angles; and global domain geometry including bathymetry and land/ocean masks. Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states. ECCO V4r4 is a free-running solution of a global, nominally 1-degree configuration of the MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) that has been fit to observations in a least-squares sense. Observational data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g., research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.



ECCO Geometry Parameters for the 0.5 degree Lat-Lon Model Grid (Version 4 Release 4)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filename: GRID_GEOMETRY_ECCO_v4r4_latlon_0p50deg.nc
shortname: ECCO_L4_GEOMETRY_05DEG_V4R4

This dataset provides geometric parameters for the regular 0.5-degree lat-lon grid from the ECCO Version 4 Release 4 (V4r4) ocean and sea-ice state estimate. Parameters include areas and lengths of grid cell sides and the horizontal and vertical coordinates of grid cell centers and corners. Additional information related to the global domain geometry (e.g., bathymetry and land/ocean masks) are also included. However, users should note these domain geometry fields are approximations because they have been interpolated from the ECCO lat-lon-cap 90 (llc90) native model grid. Users interested in exact budget closure calculations for volume, heat, salt, or momentum should use ECCO fields provided on the llc90 grid. Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimates are dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstructions of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states.

Observational data constraints used in V4r4 include sea surface height (SSH) from satellite altimeters [ERS-1/2, TOPEX/Poseidon, GFO, ENVISAT, Jason-1,2,3, CryoSat-2, and SARAL/AltiKa]; sea surface temperature (SST) from satellite radiometers [AVHRR], sea surface salinity (SSS) from the Aquarius satellite radiometer/scatterometer, ocean bottom pressure (OBP) from the GRACE satellite gravimeter; sea ice concentration from satellite radiometers [SSM/I and SSMIS], and in-situ ocean temperature and salinity measured with conductivity-temperature-depth (CTD) sensors and expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) from several programs [e.g., WOCE, GO-SHIP, Argo, and others] and platforms [e.g., research vessels, gliders, moorings, ice-tethered profilers, and instrumented pinnipeds]. V4r4 covers the period 1992-01-01T12:00:00 to 2018-01-01T00:00:00.

    
ECCO Ocean 3D Gent-Mcwilliams, Redi, and Background Vertical Diffusivity Coefficients for the Lat-Lon-Cap 90 (llc90) Native Model Grid (Version 4 Release 4)

shortname: ECCO_L4_OCEAN_3D_MIX_COEFFS_LLC0090GRID_V4R4

This dataset provides 3D coefficients for the Gent-McWilliams and Redi parameterizations and background vertical diffusivity on the lat-lon-cap 90 (llc90) native model grid from the ECCO Version 4 Release 4 (V4r4) ocean and sea-ice state estimate. Each of these three time-invariant, spatially-varying terms are estimated during the ECCO V4r4 optimization.
