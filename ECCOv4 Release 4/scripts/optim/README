Namelist files
data.optim: Need to set "fim" to fc_0 * (1-0.5*fact), where fc_0 is the total cost of 
            an initial iteration (the iteration before a steepest descent iteration);
            fact is the target fractional cost reduction. For instance, if one wants 
            to have a 0.01 (i.e., 1%) cost reduction, fmin should be set to 
            fc_0 * (1-0.01*0.5) = fc_0 * 0.995. One only needs to set it once unless 
            one wants to restart with another steepest iteration. 
data.ctrl: No need to change
data.ecco: No need to change

Executable:
optim.x: A dummy executable for optimization. See 
https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-Configurations/tree/master/ECCOv4%20Release%204/optimization 
for how to generate optim.x. One can also use their own version of optim.x.
