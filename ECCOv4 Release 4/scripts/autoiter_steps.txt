Steps on automatic optimization on Pleiades
Ou Wang

1. Start the initial iteration (iteration 0)

2. Once the forward mode of iteration 0 is finished;
Generate the executable for optimization (optim.x) following the README file in
https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-
Configurations/tree/master/ECCOv4%20Release%204/optimization
Create directories ctrl.runname and optim.runname (replace runname with the actual
run name) as specified in the example script for automating iterations at
https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-
Configurations/blob/master/ECCOv4%20Release%204/scripts/example_autoiter.csh. The
ctrl.runname will be empty. The optim.runname will be similar to the optim directory at
https://github.com/ECCO-GROUP/ECCO-v4-
Configurations/tree/master/ECCOv4%20Release%204/scripts/optim. One needs to replace the
executable optim.x with the one generated above. One also needs to set fmin in data.optim.
See the README file inside optim/.

3. After the initial iteration finished the adjoint mode, use the example script to
do multiple iterations.
