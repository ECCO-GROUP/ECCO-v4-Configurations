- This directory contains the development version of the ECCO Version 4, Release 5 configuration. 
  The patch code is based on MITgcm checkpoint67l_fileHasah, the optimized code 
  for checkpoint67l that has much better code performance on NASA AMES's Pleiades than 
  the original checkpoint67l. MITgcm checkpoint67l_fileHasah is available at 
  https://github.com/dkokron/MITgcm/tree/dkokron/checkpoint67l_fileHash.

                                       and an example run script

- To compile for an adjoint run, use the customized optfile ./other/linux_amd64_ifort+mpi_ice_nas_opt
  mkdir build
  cd build
  ../../../tools/genmake2 -mods=../code -optfile=../other/linux_amd64_ifort+mpi_ice_nas_opt -mpi 
  make depend
  make adtaf
  make adall
- An example run script is available at ./other/example_runscript.csh
  The run directory is set to ./run as where example_runscript.csh is.  
   The most important changes from a normal run script that makes no use of scratch disks on Pleiades, 
   are copy files to the scratch disk, /tmp for each node, before starting a run and copy/move 
   some output files for archive from the scratch disk back to the run directory after a run finishes.
