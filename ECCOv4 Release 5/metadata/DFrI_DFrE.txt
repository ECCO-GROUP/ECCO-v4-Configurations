DFrI_TH: 
================
*. The vertical flux 3rd component from GM-Redi is due to Kwz tensor component
and is easy to process implicitly (vertical flux function of vertical gradient)
like any vertical diffusivity contribution; this is the case when implicitDiffusion=.TRUE.

*. with useGMRedi= True, the 3rd component (from Kwz) is added to "DFrE_???" when using implicitDiffusion=.True. (implictDiffusion = True with V4r4)

DFrE_TH: 
================
* For any tracer, when using pkg/gmredi, it adds to vertical fluxes
two diffusive components that are proportional to horizontal tracer gradient
(Kwx & Kwy components of the GM-Redi tensor) and these components are always
evaluated explicitly (i.e., forward in time)

* only be non-zero if pkg/gmredi activated. "

* with useGMRedi=TRUE, the first 2 components (from Kwx & Kwy) are accounted for in diagnostics "DFrE_???";

* These terms (Kwx & Kwy) are due to the Redi tensor but are increased by some GM 
contributions when using the Skew-flux form (GM_AdvForm = .FALSE., i.e, the default).

* with useGMRedi= True, the 3rd component (from Kwz) is added to "DFrE_???" when using implicitDiffusion=.False. (implictDiffusion = True with V4r4)
