ECCO V4r5 is a dynamically and kinematically-consistent reconstruction of the three-dimensional, time-evolving ocean, sea-ice, and surface atmospheric states constructed by fitting a nominally 1-degree coupled ocean and sea-ice configuration of the MITgcm with satellite and in situ ocean and marine ice observations over the period 1992-2020.
