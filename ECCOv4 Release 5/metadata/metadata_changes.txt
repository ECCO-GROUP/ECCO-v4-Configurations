* created new time metadata for 1D, 2D, and 3D datasets
* removed time metadata from coordinate_metadata_for_latlon_datasets.json
* changed "comp" to "component" in SBO metadata variable long names "variable metadata for 1D datasets"
* changed V4r4 to V4r5 and Version 4 Release 4 to V4r5
* removed the "standard_name" from SSH and added "sea_surface_height_above_geoid" to "SSHNOIBC"
* changed some grouping names 
-- replaced "along the model x-direction" with "in the model x-direction"
-- replaced "tendency" with "tendencies" to be consistent with "fluxes" 
-- simplified to "ocean three-dimensional parameterized mixing coefficients",
-- simplified to "sea surface height", "ocean temperature and salinity", "ocean bottom pressure"
* removed references from global_metadata_for_all_datasets because we still don't have the synopsis

* renamed coordinate_metadata_for_native_datasets.json to spatial_coordinate_metadata_for_native_datasets.json
* removed time related metadata from spatial_coordinate_metadata_for_native_datasets
* cleaned up some of the descriptions of the geometry metadata for latlon and native
