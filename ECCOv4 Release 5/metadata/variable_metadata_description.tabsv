Note: oceQnet does not include the change in ocean heat content due to changing ocean ocean mass (oceFWflx). Mass fluxes from evaporation, precipitation, and runoff (EXFempmr) happen at the same temperature as the ocean surface temperature. Consequently, EmPmR does not change ocean surface temperature. Conversely, mass fluxes due to sea-ice thickening/thinning and snow melt in the model are assumed to happen at a fixed 0C. Consequently, mass fluxes due to phase changes between seawater and sea-ice and snow induce a heat flux when the ocean surface temperaure is not 0C. The variable TFLUX does include the change in ocean heat content due to changing ocean mass. 	 W m-2 	 2D

Also, the model +x direction does not necessarily correspond to the geographical east-west direction because the x and y axes of the model's curvilinear lat-lon-cap (llc) grid have arbitrary orientations which vary within and across tiles.

PHIBOT is NOT corrected for global mean steric sea level changes related to density changes in the Boussinesq volume-conserving model (Greatbatch correction, see sterGloH), and therefore should NOT be used for comparisons with ocean bottom pressure data.

However, the unqualified term 'salinity' is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand.' see https://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-standard-names/73/build/cf-standard-name-table.html 	  	 1e-3 	 3D

sIceLoad	 Average sea-ice and snow mass per unit area 	 Total mass of sea-ice and snow in a model grid cell averaged over model grid cell area 	 Note: sIceLoad is used to correct model sea level anomaly, ETAN, to calculate dynamic sea surface height, SSH, and sea surface height without the inverted barometer (IB correction), SSHNOIBC. In the model, sea-ice is treated as floating above the sea level with ETAN tracing the location of the ocean-ice interface. Consequently, sea-ice growth in the model lowers ETAN and sea-ice melting raises ETAN. Dynamic sea surface height is obtained by correcting ETAN by the weight of ice and snow directly above following Archimedes’ principle. 	 kg m-2 	 2D

SSH	 Dynamic sea surface height anomaly 	 Dynamic sea surface height anomaly above the geoid, suitable for comparisons with altimetry sea surface height data products that apply the inverse barometer (IB) correction 	 Note: SSH is calculated by correcting model sea level anomaly ETAN for three effects: a) global mean steric sea level changes related to density changes in the Boussinesq volume-conserving model (Greatbatch correction, see sterGloH), b) the inverted barometer (IB) effect (see SSHIBC) and c) sea level displacement due to sea-ice and snow pressure loading (see sIceLoad). SSH can be compared with the similarly-named SSH variable in previous ECCO products that did not include atmospheric pressure loading (e.g., Version 4 Release 3).

Note: Use SSH for model-data comparisons with altimetry data products that DO apply the IB correction and SSHNOIBC for comparisons with altimetry data products that do NOT apply the IB correction. 	 m 	 2D
SSHNOIBC	 Sea surface height anomaly without the inverted barometer (IB) correction 	 Sea surface height anomaly above the geoid without the inverse barometer (IB) correction, suitable for comparisons with altimetry sea surface height data products that do NOT apply the inverse barometer (IB) correction 	 Note: SSHNOIBC is calculated by correcting model sea level anomaly ETAN for two effects: a) global mean steric sea level changes related to density changes in the Boussinesq volume-conserving model (Greatbatch correction, see sterGloH), b) sea level displacement due to sea-ice and snow pressure loading (see sIceLoad). In ECCO Version 4 Release 4 the model is forced with atmospheric pressure loading.
